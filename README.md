# AI-Powered Resume Screening & Semantic Hiring System

## Project Overview
Most hiring systems rely on keyword matching, which often misclassifies candidates due to lack of contextual understanding. This project builds an AI-based resume screening system that performs semantic similarity matching and skill gap analysis for more accurate hiring decisions.

## Problem Statement
Automated hiring systems often make inaccurate decisions because they depend mainly on simple keyword matching instead of truly understanding a candidate’s skills and experience. As a result, they struggle to understand the real meaning behind resumes, recognize skills that aren’t stated directly, spot important skill gaps, and ensure fair and unbiased hiring decisions.
The goal of this project is to build a smarter resume screening system that goes beyond keywords. It uses semantic understanding to capture the context of a resume, compares candidates more accurately with job requirements, highlights missing or required skills, and applies clear, multi-level decision rules for fair classification. Most importantly, it delivers structured and explainable recommendations that hiring teams can trust and act on with confidence.

## Features

- Semantic resume-job description similarity matching
- Skill match percentage calculation
- Implicit competency detection
- Bias-aware multi-level candidate classification
- Skill gap identification


## Innovation Feature

This system uses semantic similarity scoring to truly understand the context of a candidate’s resume rather than just matching keywords. It combines this semantic score with the percentage of skill match to create a more accurate evaluation. By applying a multi-threshold decision logic, the system classifies candidates fairly and consistently. It also highlights any missing skills, helping candidates understand areas for improvement. Finally, the hiring decision is made based on the overall skill match percentage, ensuring a balanced and data-driven recommendation.
